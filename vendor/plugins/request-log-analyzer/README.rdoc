= Request-log-analyzer

This is a simple command line tool to analyze request log files of both Rails and
Merb to produce a performance report. Its purpose is to find what actions are best candidates for optimization.

* Analyzes Rails log files (all versions), Merb logs, or any other log format you specify
* Combines multiple files and decompresses compressed files (handy if you are using logrotate)
* Uses several metrics, including cumulative request time, average request time, process blockers, database and rendering time, HTTP methods and statuses, Rails action cache statistics, etc.) (Sample output: http://wiki.github.com/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer/sample-output)
* Low memory footprint and reasonably fast (server-safe)
* MIT licensed

Request log analyzer was designed and built by Willem van Bergen and Bart ten Brinke.
